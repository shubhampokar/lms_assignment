---> 6  what is temproray table ? what is the purpose of temp table ? create one temp table 

--Ans. 	Temporary table is a table that is not stored in the database permanently and exists only while the database session in which it was created is active.
--		Temporary table have many use cases. It helps to simplify our code, decreases execution time for our queries and many more.
CREATE TEMP TABLE dt_demo_sub_2 (a, b, c) 
AS 
SELECT uuid_dt, arr_dt, cust_dt
FROM datatype_demo
WHERE text_dt IS NULL;





---> 7  difference between delete and truncate ? 

--Ans. 	The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and makes an entry in the transaction log for each rows. 
--		TRUNCATE statement removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page deallocations in the transaction log. 
--		DELETE command is slower than TRUNCATE command.
--		DELETE can be used for removing particular record while TRUNCATE removes all records.
